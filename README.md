# Open Source IOT Vending Machine Project

The Project consists of 3 main achievements:

- Web App
- Microcontroller Firmware
- Maintenance, Parts, & Operations
- Licensing & Legal Documentation

## Web App

Public Frontend: 

- find-a-machine
- Online payments per transaction, prepaid vouchers, or subscription ( i hate subscription services for products)
- pre-order for items that take preparation; i.e pizza machines, hot pies, etc.

Management Frontend:

- Inventory Management: w/auto-replenish notifications
- Advertising Orchestration for LCD panels
- Vending machine location management
- price-setter by the location/item/15min for price scheduling 


Backend:

- Database Magic
- Invoicing, user management, & traffic analytics
- Storage for advertising & inventory assets

## Microcontroller Firmware


## Maintenance, Parts, & Operations

### Parts & Assembly/Dissembly

#### Community Designs

This is where contributors submit their own compliant versions, and if they have any specific firmware changes based on different parts. But more commonly different CAD files for 3D printing & designs in general. All of which will contain the same license if accepted.
I may stil want to dedicate a different section to those who would like to have different licenses so they can still prosper/profit, but that isn't a goal/priority of mine yet.

### Operations

### Maintenance

## Licensing & Legal Documentation

### License 

MIT for now. 

### Data Collection Policy

I would like this to be opt-in, so when you enable tracking, analytics & such, you could receive rewards for doing so as that is important because that information is definitely profitable, best to give the users some respect.
